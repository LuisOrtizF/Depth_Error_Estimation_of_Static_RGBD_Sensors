# <center> Depth Error Estimation of Static RGBD Sensors

---
This project allows computing the error in static RGB-D sensors. The code is the implementation of the papers: __[A Versatile Method for Depth Data Error Estimation in RGB-D Sensors](https://doi.org/10.3390/s18093122)__ and __[Depth Data Error Modeling of the ZED 3D Vision Sensor From Stereolabs](https://doi.org/10.5565/rev/elcvia.1084)__.

## Installation:
---

Dependences (mandatory):

+ **Eigen3**
+ **OpenCV**: tested with version 3.4.1.

Download code and open a terminal `ctrl+t`:

    $ cd path 
    $ mkdir build & cd build 
    $ cmake .. 
    $ make

## How to use:
---

+ **Run**: `./depth_error <save_windows> <device> <devide_resolution>`

+ **Inputs**:
    * `<save_windows>`: set `1` to save the pictures of the PCL 3D visualizer with the point clouds used to the depth error. Or choose `0` to save nothing.
    * `<device>`: choose the sensor to be evaluated, can be `1` for the __[Stereolabs ZED ](https://www.stereolabs.com/)__ camera or `2` for Kinect
    * `<devide_resolution>`: choose the resolution of the device that you use, for example: `4` for ZED `(672x376 px)`, `5` for Kinect version 1 `(640x480  px)` and `6` for Kinect version 2 `(512x424 px)`. Remember that the Kinect version 2 has two resolutions, `(1920x1080)` and `(512x424 px)`. We use the minor resolution because it is more similar to the other devices' resolutions, i.e., to make the comparison of the devices fairer.

+ **Outputs**:
    * `built/Results/`: a folder that contains the pictures of the PCL 3D visualizer with the point clouds used to the depth error. 
    * `Table_<devide_resolution>.txt`: *.txt* file with two columns, the first one represents the depth in millimeters, and the second one represents the RMSE error for this depth.

+ Example:
    ```
    $ ./depth_error 1 1 4 
    ```
